# wiki_extension
Wikipedia extension for Google Chrome that is NOT YEAR COMPLETION YET.

# What it does so far
So far, the extension allows users to search for Wikipedia pages at the touch of a button. Simply click the extension button in the corner of Google Chrome and type your search query and a preview of related Wikipedia pages.

# Future plans
In the future, I would like for the extension to pull any relevant information that it can off the current browser page and try to find Wikipedia articles that might be related to the current page the user is looking at. For example, if the user is looking at a page about cats, the extension might suggest the Wikipedia page for cats.
